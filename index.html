        <h1>Checkout Machine at RISD Bolt Cafe</h1>
        <p>This website explains my project on Storyboards and Personas. I chose the payment machine at the RISD Bolt Cafe as my interface. I observed three people interacting with the interface and discussed their experience with them. Based on these interviews, I created two personas and made a storyboard based on one of my personas. Enjoy!</p>

        <h1>Interface Sketch and Caption:</h1>
        <p>This interface works to solve how a coffee shop, Bolt, processes the payments of its customers. The interface operates with one large touch screen, offering payment options of Apple Pay, card insertion, card touch, Cash App and cash. The Apple Pay and card touch options are exhibited using a clear image at the top of the interface and a tap label with an arrow indicating towards it.  There is a qr code on the right center of the interface so that customers can download the Cash App on the spot and pay that way. There is an image of the top of a credit card, as well as arrows directing the user to a credit card insertion point for the insertion option. The option to pay with cash is not exhibited explicitly on the interface.</p>

        <h1>Key Observations From Observing My Users:</h1>
        <ul>
          <p>From observing my users, they all seemed to interact with the interface calmly and with ease, regardless of whether they had used the interface before and of the payment method they used (credit card or apple pay). There was very little variation amongst the users in spite of the visible variation in age and sex. </p>
        </ul>
        <h1>Based on my interviews, I discerned the following key information:</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Some users felt that they could tell exactly where to tap the card on the machine so that it could be read, others felt that this was unclear and there was some confusion.  One user used a chip reader and wasn't sure where to tap the card.</li>
          <li>People felt the interface was simple, clean, intuitive and sleek.</li>
          <li>“Simple” was a consistent adjective used by users to describe the machine. </li>
          <li>The tipping system was easy to use, with clear instructions.</li>
          <li>For the user that was new to the interface, the point system at the end of the checkout seemed unclear.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Empathy Map 1: Calm Catherine</h1>
        <h2>Character description:</h2>
        <p>Calm Catherine is a part time art History professor at RISD, specializing in 18th century French Painters. She often stops at Bolt to get a chai and a snack after her lectures before heading home. </p>
        <h2>Interface problems my persona faces:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Deciding whether she will get her food to eat in or eat out and how that will affect her tip.</li>
          <li>Figuring out how to pay and with what payment method. </li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Why and How persona represents users of your chosen interface:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Two out of the three people I interviewed regularly interacted with the interface, understanding how to operate it.</li>
          <li>Two out of three users had their food inside the cafe.</li>

        <h1>Empathy Map 2: Stressed Sally</h1>
        <h2>Character description:</h2>
        <p>Stressed Sally is a sculpture student at RISD.  She has been prepping for her midterms and spending late nights in the studio. She needs a steady flow of caffeine to function, but she always runs late, and stops at Bolt in a rush in between classes. </p>
        <h2>Interface problems my persona faces:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Knowing how much to tip in a rush since she isn’t staying to sit.
            </li>
          <li>Knowing how to pay using her phone as Sally has forgotten her credit card.</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Why and How persona represents users of your chosen interface:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>One of the people I interviewed used apple pay to pay for their item, as does Sally. 
            </li>
          <li>One of the people I interviewed got their item to go, so they also had to take the same things into consideration when it came to leaving a tip. </li>
